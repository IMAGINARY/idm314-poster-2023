2023 IDM Poster with the theme "Mathematics for Everyone"

## The poster is not finished...

The poster is not finished until you take part in it!

Draw faces on each of the dots, showing the diversity of people who can experience mathematics 
through exploration, play, creativity, research, learning, solving problems, and more.

The bottom left corner of the poster has a blank space to place the details of your own IDM events.

## The dots background

The dot background was created with a simple program, which you can find in the `dots`
folder.

To run it, place all files in the directory in a web server. You might also try opening them
directly with your web browser, but that might not work. Try the latest version of Google Chrome
if your browser does not work.

You can look at the algorithm in `src/dots/index.js`. The sources are commented, and you can
use them to experiment and create variations on the pattern.
